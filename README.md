## About
I made this basic page to show my skils in React, TypeScript, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

It is page with a list of products /caravans/.

The page contains:
- Header, Layout
- Filters
  - Slider for price
  - Caranvas type - multiple select [Campervan, Intergrated, BuiltIn , Alcove]
  - Instant booking - simple toggle [true / false]
- List of caravans
- Button for loading more caravans
- NextImage for caravan pictures
- NextHead
- One breakpoint for mobil - 400px
